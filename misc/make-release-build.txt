Dev-dependency for minifying JS
- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/issue-with-global-node-npm-packages/ (shows how to add and use local npm-commandline tools in your project)

******* ANDROID *********
After creating a signing key we can create a release build using the commandline tools from nativescript

command:
tns build android [--compileSdk <API Level>] [--key-store-path <File Path> --key-store-password <Password> --key-store-alias <Name> --key-store-alias password <Password>] [--release] [--static-bindings] [--copy-to <File Path>]

Modify the above command to fit your needs and leave out the undesired options

******* iOS *********
command:
tns build ios [--for-device] [--release] [--copy-to <File Path>]

NOTE: valid certificate information should be configured in your xcode to build the app
